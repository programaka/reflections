1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

You see what part of your code changed and this is exactly the part where the bug is.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

As we saw previously, it would be much easier and hence faster to find the location of a bug.
You could copy paste you code from previous versions.
If any of your features failed in production, you would be able to return to a previous version of you system without rewriting your code.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git was created for versioning code. And when writing code, for example adding a new feature to your code, it often affects multiple files. So it just makes sense to add all the files required for you application to run in a single commit. 

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always go back. No fear to loose something. Imagine you had a version control of your life!

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

to create a repository for my wiki project and use git while working on the project
