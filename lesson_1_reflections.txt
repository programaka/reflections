1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

You see what part of your code changed and this is exactly the part where the bug is.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

As we saw previously, it would be much easier and hence faster to find the location of a bug.
You could copy paste you code from previous versions.
If any of your features failed in production, you would be able to return to a previous version of you system without rewriting your code.
